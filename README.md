# C06 - Hierarchical grids

### Scene: 2d space, with n random positioned AABB boxes within some boundary, set initial velocity random ✔

### Implement simple coherent motion ✔

### Integrate positions with explicit Euler ✔

### On boundary negate velocity ✔

### Implement naive n^2 broad phase collision detection ✔

#### Implement hierarchical grid broad phase (AddBox, RemoveBox, UpdateBox)

#### Grids are stored by spatial hashing in hash tables

#### Compare results (pairs) and times of both algorithms

#### Implement simple (full matrix) pair management
